<h2>1. The 50-30-20 Rule for Budgeting</h2>
<p>This popular rule helps allocate your monthly income effectively into three categories:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>50% for Needs:</strong> These are non-negotiable expenses required for your survival.  
        Examples:
        <ul>
            <li>Housing (rent or home loan EMI)</li>
            <li>Groceries and utilities (electricity, water, internet, etc.)</li>
            <li>Transportation (fuel, public transport, etc.)</li>
            <li>Insurance premiums</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>30% for Wants:</strong> These are discretionary expenses that improve your lifestyle and bring joy.  
        Examples:
        <ul>
            <li>Dining out</li>
            <li>Entertainment subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify, etc.)</li>
            <li>Travel and vacations</li>
            <li>Shopping for non-essential items</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>20% for Savings and Investments:</strong> This portion builds your financial future and safeguards against emergencies.  
        Examples:
        <ul>
            <li>Emergency fund contributions</li>
            <li>SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) in mutual funds</li>
            <li>Investments in PPF (Public Provident Fund) or NPS (National Pension System)</li>
            <li>Prepayment of loans</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why Use This Rule?</strong> It simplifies budgeting and ensures you balance living for today with preparing for the future.</p>

<h2>2. The FIRE Number (Financial Independence, Retire Early)</h2>
<p>FIRE is a movement aimed at achieving financial independence and retiring early by saving aggressively and investing smartly.</p>

<h3>How to Calculate Your FIRE Number</h3>
<p><strong>Determine Your Annual Expenses:</strong> Total your monthly expenses and multiply by 12. Be sure to include all recurring expenses such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rent or home maintenance</li>
    <li>Groceries</li>
    <li>Utilities</li>
    <li>Entertainment</li>
    <li>Insurance premiums</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Adjust for Inflation and Lifestyle Changes:</strong> Consider that costs will increase with inflation (assume 5–7% annually in India). Add a buffer for medical expenses and lifestyle upgrades.</p>

<p><strong>Apply the 25x Rule:</strong> Multiply your annual expenses by 25 to calculate the corpus needed to sustain yourself using a 4% annual withdrawal rate.</p>

<h4>Example:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Monthly Expenses: ₹50,000</li>
    <li>Annual Expenses: ₹50,000 × 12 = ₹6,00,000</li>
    <li>FIRE Number: ₹6,00,000 × 25 = ₹1.5 crore</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Strategies to Achieve FIRE:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Save 50–70% of your income.</li>
    <li>Invest aggressively in equity and balanced mutual funds.</li>
    <li>Avoid lifestyle inflation by keeping discretionary expenses low.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. The 100 Minus Age Rule for Asset Allocation</h2>
<p>This rule helps determine the ideal allocation of your investment portfolio between equity (stocks or mutual funds) and debt (fixed-income instruments):</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Equity Investments:</strong> Higher risk, higher returns. Suitable for younger individuals.</li>
    <li><strong>Debt Investments:</strong> Lower risk, stable returns. Provides security as you age.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>Subtract your age from 100. The result is the percentage of your portfolio that should be in equities. The remainder should be allocated to debt instruments.</p>

<h4>Example for a 30-Year-Old:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Equity: 100 - 30 = 70%</li>
    <li>Debt: 30%</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> You can adjust based on risk tolerance. For aggressive investors, use “110 minus age” to increase equity exposure.</p>

<h2>4. Emergency Fund Rule</h2>
<p>An emergency fund is a financial safety net to cover unexpected expenses like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Job loss</li>
    <li>Medical emergencies</li>
    <li>Car or home repairs</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Much to Save?</h3>
<p>Save 3–6 months’ worth of essential living expenses. Example: If your monthly essential expenses are ₹40,000, your emergency fund should be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Minimum: ₹1,20,000 (3 months)</li>
    <li>Maximum: ₹2,40,000 (6 months)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Where to Save It?</h3>
<p>Keep this fund in liquid and low-risk investments for easy access:</p>
<ul>
    <li>High-yield savings accounts</li>
    <li>Fixed deposits with premature withdrawal options</li>
    <li>Liquid mutual funds</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. The 4% Rule for Safe Withdrawals</h2>
<p>The 4% rule ensures you can withdraw from your retirement corpus without exhausting it during your lifetime.</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>Withdraw 4% of your total investment corpus annually for living expenses. The corpus is invested in a balanced portfolio to grow enough to keep up with inflation.</p>

<h4>Example:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Retirement Corpus: ₹2 crore</li>
    <li>Annual Withdrawal: ₹2 crore × 4% = ₹8,00,000</li>
    <li>Monthly Withdrawal: ₹8,00,000 ÷ 12 = ₹66,667</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Historical data shows that a well-balanced portfolio (60% equity, 40% debt) can sustain withdrawals at this rate for over 30 years.</p>
